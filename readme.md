## JobConnect-API
JobConnect is an online job portal platform that connects job seekers with employers. It simplifies the job search and
recruitment process by allowing job seekers to find and apply for jobs while enabling employers to post job listings and
manage applications.

### Key Features
- Admin: Manages employers and reviews job posts for approval or rejection.
- Job Seekers: Search for jobs, apply with proposals (including attachments), save job posts, and communicate with employers
after proposal acceptance.
- Employers: Post job listings, review proposals, and communicate with job seekers once a proposal is accepted.

### Future Enhancements
- Search Filters: Currently, basic search functionality is provided. In future updates, advanced filters such as location,
industry, job title, salary range, and posting date will be implemented to enhance job search capabilities.
